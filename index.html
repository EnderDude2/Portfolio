        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="StGi"> </div>
        <p> Born and raised in Denver, Colorado, Stuart always had a penchant for the creative. He grew up as an athlete, but always felt at home on the stage. After spending a year at SMU's conservatory studying acting, Stuart decided to broaden his horizons and transferred to Brown University. There he studied theatre with an emphasis in acting and writing. He also continued to play sports, and was a member of the prestigious Jabberwocks a cappella group. After a playwriting professor told him he should try writing screenplays (because his plays were "impossible to mount on a stage"), he teamed up with friend Benji Samit and they began making movies.
            <br /> <br />Stuart wrote and starred in My Girlfriend's Abroad (2006) during his senior year at Brown, a project that sparked a move to Los Angeles. After their first year writing in LA together, Stuart and Benji parted ways citing "creative differences." Stuart was offered a position as a teaching artist in his home state of Colorado at the Tony-winning Denver Center Theatre Company. He taught media, acting, playwriting, and performance. He continues to write screenplays, and has worked as an actor, producer, and director. He has since returned to Los Angeles, where he resides.
